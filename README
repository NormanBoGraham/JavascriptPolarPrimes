In Javascript, Convert from Polar Co-ordinates to Cartesian use these equations: 
     x = r * cos (angle)
     y = r * sin (angle)
   where, angle is in radians (not degrees).   

 
360 degrees = 6.28319 radians.

Primes are at the polar quardinate radius + something, to make them expand outward the greater the number. 
and at the angle, prime%360.
